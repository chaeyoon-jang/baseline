 若干子问题:   ['What is the name of Michael J. Fox's current spouse?', 'Has Michael J. Fox been married more than once? If so, who were his previous spouses?', 'When did Michael J. Fox get married to his current or most recent spouse?'] 
主题实体是: Michael J. Fox 
已有的推理步骤:
Michael J. Fox -> people.person.spouse_s -> m.02kkmrn 
基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

The given path provides a direct link from Michael J. Fox to one of his spouses, represented by the entity 'm.02kkmrn'. This path is highly relevant to answering the first subquestion, 'What is the name of Michael J. Fox's current spouse?' However, since 'm.02kkmrn' is a placeholder for a specific person and not a named entity, we cannot directly conclude the name of the spouse without further information. Additionally, the path does not provide information about whether Michael J. Fox has been married more than once or when he got married to his current or most recent spouse, which are addressed in the second and third subquestions. Despite these limitations, the path is on the right track and contains key information needed to answer the primary question. Therefore, the score is 0.85, indicating a high likelihood of leading to the correct answer with just one more hop to identify the name of the spouse.

Michael J. Fox -> celebrities.romantic_relationship.celebrity -> m.0cy4qv7 
基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

The evidence path provided gives us a direct link from Michael J. Fox to his romantic relationship with another celebrity, represented by the entity 'm.0cy4qv7'. This path is highly relevant to the first subquestion, 'What is the name of Michael J. Fox's current spouse?' and partially addresses the second subquestion, 'Has Michael J. Fox been married more than once? If so, who were his previous spouses?'. However, it does not provide information regarding the timing of their marriage, which is necessary to fully address the third subquestion, 'When did Michael J. Fox get married to his current or most recent spouse?'. Despite this limitation, the path is on the right track and can be extended to find the name of the spouse and potentially other details about their relationship. Thus, the score reflects the high relevance but acknowledges the missing information.

基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

The given path indicates that Michael J. Fox dated someone, but it does not specify if this person is his current spouse or a previous one. Moreover, the endpoint 'm.065qm7' is just an identifier and does not provide any direct information about the individual's name or relationship status with Michael J. Fox. While this path gives some relevant information, it is insufficient to fully answer the question or the subquestions. It would require additional steps to determine if 'm.065q2m7' is indeed his current spouse and when they got married, or if he has been married to others before. Therefore, the score is 0.45, indicating partial relevance but needing more information.

None 

The given path only provides information about Michael J. Fox's place of birth, which is Edmonton. This information is irrelevant to answering the question "who did Michael J. Fox marry?" and the subquestions related to his marital status and spouses. Therefore, the score for this path is low, as it does not contain any relevant information to infer the answers to the question and subquestions.

The given path only connects Michael J. Fox to a webpage topic, which does not provide any direct information about his marital status or spouse. To answer the question and subquestions, we would need a path that leads to information about Michael J. Fox's marriage(s) and spouse(s). The current path does not contain the necessary information and is not on the right track to answer the question or subquestions. Therefore, the score is low at 0.25.

Therefore, this path is not relevant to answering the question or subquestions about Michael J. Fox's marital status and spouses.

None 

The evidence path provided gives us a direct link to one of Michael J. Fox's spouses, Tracy Pollan. This path is highly relevant to the first subquestion, 'What is the name of Michael J. Fox's current spouse?' and partially addresses the second subquestion, 'Has Michael J. Fox been married more than once? If so, who were his previous spouses?'. However, it does not provide information regarding the timing of their marriage, which is necessary to fully answer the third subquestion, 'When did Michael J. Fox get married to his current or most recent spouse?'. Despite this gap, the path is still quite strong as it provides key information needed to answer two out of three subquestions. Thus, the score is 0.85.

已有的推理步骤:
Michael J. Fox -> people.person.spouse_s -> m.02kkmrn -> people.marriage.type_of_union -> Marriage 
基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

The given path partially addresses the first subquestion by identifying one of Michael J. Fox's spouses, but it does not provide the name of the spouse, which is crucial for answering the question. Additionally, the path does not address the second and third subquestions regarding whether he has been married more than once and when he got married to his current or most recent spouse. The entity 'm.02kkmrn' is likely a placeholder for a specific person, but without knowing the name, the path is incomplete. Furthermore, the last hop towards 'people.marriage.type_of_union -> Marriage' does not add any useful information to the reasoning process. Therefore, the score is 0.58, indicating that while the path is somewhat relevant, it lacks the necessary details to fully answer the question and all subquestions.

基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

The given path starts by identifying Michael J. Fox's spouse, but then shifts to the location of their marriage ceremony, which is Arlington. While this path provides some relevant information, it does not fully address all the subquestions. It identifies the spouse indirectly through 'm.02kkmrn' which needs further deduction to confirm the spouse's name. Additionally, it does not provide information on whether Michael J. Fox has been married more than once or when he got married to his current spouse. Thus, the path is partially useful but lacks comprehensive information to fully answer the question and all subquestions. Therefore, the score is 0.58.

The evidence path provides information about Michael J. Fox's spouse, Tracy Pollan, and their child, Esmé Annabelle Fox. It answers the first subquestion regarding the name of Michael J. Fox's current spouse. However, it does not provide information about whether he has been married more than once or when he got married to his current spouse. The path is relevant but incomplete for fully answering all subquestions. Therefore, the score is 0.75.

The candidate multi-hop evidence path does not contain any relevant information to answer the question or subquestions. The path leads to a webpage annotation about Michael J. Fox returning to TV, which is unrelated to his marital status or spouses. Therefore, the score for this path is low, as it does not provide any useful information to infer the answers to the question and subquestions.

The given path does not seem to lead directly to the information about Michael J. Fox's marriage. The path starts with connecting Michael J. Fox to a webpage topic, but the intermediate steps do not provide any relevant information about his marital status or spouse. The final entity, "Entertainment Weekly annotation index," does not appear to contain specific details about Michael J. Fox's personal life or marriages. Therefore, the path does not provide the necessary information to answer the question or subquestions effectively. However, there is a slight possibility that the webpage might contain some indirect clues, hence the score is not zero.

None 

The initial part of the path correctly identifies Michael J. Fox's spouse as Tracy Pollan, which is relevant to the first subquestion 'What is the name of Michael J. Fox's current spouse?'. However, the path then deviates by focusing on Tracy Pollan's child, Esmé Annabelle Fox, and eventually leads to the place of birth, which is not pertinent to the original question or subquestions. The path does not address the second subquestion 'Has Michael J. Fox been married more than once? If so, who were his previous spouses?' nor the third subquestion 'When did Michael J. Fox get married to his current or most recent spouse?'. Therefore, while the path provides some useful information, it is not comprehensive enough to fully answer all subquestions, resulting in a score of 0.58.

The evidence path provided gives some relevant information about Michael J. Fox's marriage, specifically identifying one of his spouses (m.02kkmrn) and the location of the ceremony (Arlington, United States of America). However, the path does not directly provide the name of his spouse, nor does it address whether he has been married more than once or when he got married to his current or most recent spouse. While the path is somewhat relevant, it lacks the necessary details to fully answer the question and all subquestions. Therefore, the score is 0.45.

基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

The given path starts by linking Stonewall Jackson to his military service, which is relevant to the question about the battles he fought in. However, the endpoint 'm.012_03y_' does not provide direct information about specific battles or engagements. To fully answer the question and subquestions, the path would need to continue to connect 'm.012_03y_' to specific battles or conflicts where Stonewall Jackson was involved. As it stands, the path is on the right track but lacks the necessary detail to confidently answer the question and subquestions. Therefore, the score is 0.45.

已有的推理步骤:

基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

This path provides relevant information by linking Stonewall Jackson to the conflicts he participated in, specifically mentioning the Seven Days Battles. It addresses the first subquestion by identifying a major battle that Stonewall Jackson fought in during the Civil War. While it does not cover all the battles or skirmishes he was involved in, nor does it explicitly mention his tactical decisions' impact, it is a strong start. Further steps along this path could reveal more battles and potentially address the other subquestions. Therefore, the score reflects the high likelihood of this path leading to a comprehensive answer with additional information.

已有的推理步骤:
Stonewall Jackson -> military.military_commander.military_commands -> m.049y34w 
基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

The given path connects Stonewall Jackson to his military commands, but the endpoint 'm.049y34w' does not provide direct information about the battles he fought in. While this path is relevant as it links Jackson to his military roles, it does not directly address the subquestions about specific battles or engagements. To fully answer the question and subquestions, additional steps would be necessary to link these military commands to specific battles. Therefore, the score reflects that while the path is on the right track, it is not sufficient to confidently infer the answers without further information.

基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

This path provides a direct link between Stonewall Jackson and one of the battles he fought in, the Battle of McDowell. It addresses the first subquestion by identifying a battle that Stonewall Jackson participated in during the Civil War. However, it only covers one battle and does not provide information about other battles or specific engagements he led or took part in, nor does it mention any notable battles where his tactical decisions had a significant impact. To fully answer all subquestions, additional steps would be necessary to identify more battles and their significance. Nonetheless, the path is on the right track and provides valuable information towards answering the overall question. Therefore, the score is 0.75.

None 

The given path identifies Stonewall Jackson as a military commander, but it does not provide direct information about the battles he fought in. While it confirms his role in military command, it does not link him to specific battles or engagements, which are necessary to answer the question and subquestions. To fully address the query, the path would need to include relations that connect Stonewall Jackson to specific battles or conflicts he was involved in. Therefore, the score reflects that while the path is relevant, it lacks the necessary detail to confidently answer the question and subquestions.

None 

The given path only indicates that Stonewall Jackson was notable for something, but it does not specify what battles he fought in or his role in those battles. The entity 'g.125781qrp' is likely a placeholder or an intermediate node that doesn't provide direct information about the battles. To answer the question and subquestions, we would need a path that leads to specific battles or engagements where Stonewall Jackson participated. Therefore, the current path is not sufficient to reason about the question and subquestions effectively.

None 

The given path provides a direct link between Stonewall Jackson and one of the battles he fought in, the First Battle of Bull Run. This is relevant to the first subquestion asking about the major battles Stonewall Jackson participated in during the Civil War. While this path alone does not cover all the subquestions, it is a strong start and demonstrates the feasibility of finding other battles he was involved in using similar paths. With additional hops, it would be possible to gather information about other battles and skirmishes he led or took part in, as well as his tactical decisions' impacts. Therefore, the score reflects the high likelihood of this path leading to the answers for the question and subquestions.

The evidence path starts correctly by linking Stonewall Jackson to the conflicts he participated in, specifically mentioning the Seven Days Battles. However, the path then shifts focus to the 2nd Louisiana Infantry Regiment and their conflicts, which is not directly relevant to answering the subquestions about Stonewall Jackson's battles. While the path provides some context about the Seven Days Battles, it does not fully address the specific engagements or notable battles where Stonewall Jackson's tactical decisions had a significant impact. To improve the path, it would be beneficial to continue focusing on Stonewall Jackson's direct involvement in these battles and his tactical decisions. Therefore, the score is 0.58, indicating partial relevance but requiring further refinement.

The given path starts by linking Stonewall Jackson to the conflicts he participated in, specifically mentioning the Seven Days Battles. This is relevant to the first subquestion about the major battles he fought in during the Civil War. However, the path then shifts to identifying commanders of the Seven Days Battles, ending with an entity that appears to be another commander (indicated by 'm.04ywph6'). While this path provides some useful information, it does not fully address all subquestions, particularly the second and third ones regarding specific engagements or skirmishes and notable battles where his tactical decisions had significant impact. Nonetheless, the path is on the right track and could be extended to include more detailed information about Stonewall Jackson's role in these battles, leading to a higher score of 0.75.

The given path starts by linking Stonewall Jackson to the conflicts he participated in, specifically mentioning the Seven Days Battles. This is relevant to the first subquestion about the major battles he fought in during the Civil War. However, the path then shifts to the military units involved in the Seven Days Battles, which is less directly relevant to the subquestions about Stonewall Jackson's specific engagements or tactical impacts. While this path provides some useful information, it does not fully address all the subquestions, particularly those asking about his leadership roles or tactical impacts. Therefore, the score reflects that the path is partially relevant but lacks comprehensive coverage of the full scope of the question and subquestions.

基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

The evidence path starts correctly by linking Stonewall Jackson to a battle he was involved in, the First Battle of Bull Run. However, the path then shifts focus to another military person, William Farrar Smith, rather than continuing to explore Stonewall Jackson's involvement in other battles or his tactical decisions. This shift reduces the relevance of the path to answering the question and subquestions. While the initial hop is relevant, the subsequent hops do not contribute to identifying other battles or assessing the impact of Stonewall Jackson's tactics. Therefore, the score reflects that the path partially addresses the first subquestion but fails to address the second and third subquestions effectively.

None 

The given path partially addresses the question by linking Stonewall Jackson to the First Battle of Bull Run, which is indeed one of the battles he fought in during the Civil War. However, the path ends at an entity starting with 'm.', which suggests that further deduction is necessary to fully answer the question and subquestions. Additionally, the path only covers one battle, whereas the subquestions ask for multiple battles and specific engagements or skirmishes. To improve the score, the path would need to include more battles and provide more detailed information about Stonewall Jackson's involvement and tactical decisions in these battles. Nonetheless, the path is on the right track and could potentially be expanded to cover more battles and details, making the score 0.58.

None 

The given path starts correctly by linking Stonewall Jackson to a battle he was involved in, the First Battle of Bull Run. However, the path then shifts focus to the conflicts participated in by the 7th Louisiana Infantry Regiment, which is not directly relevant to answering the question or subquestions about Stonewall Jackson's battles. To properly address the question, the path would need to continue focusing on battles and engagements led or participated in by Stonewall Jackson himself. Thus, while the initial steps are relevant, the path diverges into less useful information, making it only partially helpful in reasoning about the question and subquestions.

The given path partially addresses the first subquestion by identifying a battle that Stonewall Jackson was involved in, namely the Battle of McDowell. However, the path then shifts focus to another military personnel, Nathaniel McLean, which is irrelevant to the original question and subquestions. To fully address the question and subquestions, the path would need to continue focusing on Stonewall Jackson's involvement in other battles and his tactical decisions. Therefore, the score is 0.45, acknowledging that the path begins correctly but diverges from the necessary information.

The given path starts by linking Stonewall Jackson to the Battle of McDowell, which is relevant to the question about the battles he fought in. It then moves to another battle (m.04fv9q6) via a military conflict relation. While the path is on the right track, it does not explicitly state the name of the second battle, making it less informative. However, it does provide a connection to multiple battles, which is crucial for answering the question and subquestions. With additional steps, it could potentially link to other battles Stonewall Jackson was involved in, thus increasing the likelihood of fully answering the question and subquestions. Therefore, the score is 0.78.

The provided path gives us some relevant information about the battles Stonewall Jackson fought in, specifically mentioning the Battle of McDowell and the Jackson's Valley Campaign. This information is pertinent to the subquestions, particularly the first two, which ask about the major battles and specific engagements he was involved in. However, the path does not fully cover all aspects of the question and subquestions, especially the third subquestion which asks about battles where his tactical decisions had a significant impact. To improve the score, the path would need to include more specific battles and their outcomes. Nonetheless, the current path is on the right track and provides valuable context, hence the score of 0.78.

The evidence path partially addresses the first subquestion by identifying that Stonewall Jackson was involved in the First Battle of Bull Run, which is a relevant battle during the Civil War. However, the path then diverges to discuss another commander, P. G. T. Beauregard, rather than continuing to explore other battles or Stonewall Jackson's role in them. To fully address the question and all subquestions, the path would need to continue to identify other battles and Jackson's specific engagements or tactical impacts. Therefore, the score reflects that while some relevant information is provided, the path is not comprehensive enough to fully answer the question and all subquestions.

While this path provides some relevant information, it does not fully address all aspects of the question and subquestions, hence the score of 0.58. To improve the score, the path would need to include more direct connections to other battles and specific engagements led by Stonewall Jackson.

The evidence path provided partially addresses the question and subquestions by linking Stonewall Jackson to the Battle of McDowell, which is one of the battles he fought in. However, the path becomes circular and redundant when it loops back to Stonewall Jackson without providing additional information about other battles or his tactical decisions. To fully address the question and subquestions, the path would need to include more specific details about other battles and engagements, as well as the impact of his tactical decisions. Despite this limitation, the path does provide some relevant information, hence the score of 0.58.

None 

The evidence path partially addresses the question and subquestions by identifying some of the battles and campaigns that Stonewall Jackson was involved in, such as the Battle of McDowell and the Jackson's Valley Campaign. However, the path diverges towards the end by focusing on Richard S. Ewell, which is not directly relevant to answering the question about Stonewall Jackson's battles. To fully address the subquestions, the path would need to continue focusing on Stonewall Jackson's direct involvement in battles and his tactical decisions. Therefore, the score reflects that the path is on the right track but lacks the necessary focus and completeness to fully answer the question and subquestions.

None 

The provided evidence path connects Stonewall Jackson to specific battles he fought in, namely the Battle of McDowell and the Battle of Cross Keys, both of which are part of the larger Jackson's Valley Campaign. This path is highly relevant to the subquestions, as it identifies specific battles and campaigns in which Stonewall Jackson was involved. It provides direct links to the battles and campaigns, which can help in identifying the major battles, specific engagements, and notable battles where his tactical decisions had significant impacts. However, the path might not cover all the battles Stonewall Jackson fought in, so the score is not perfect but still quite high.

基于以上步骤，可能的当前步可能的关系是:

None 

The provided evidence path connects Stonewall Jackson to a specific battle he fought in, namely the Battle of Chancellorsville. This path is highly relevant to the question and subquestions, as it identifies a major battle that Stonewall Jackson participated in during the Civil War, which addresses subquestion 1 and partially addresses subquestion 2. However, the path ends with an intermediate entity 'm.049y34w' which requires further deduction to fully understand the context and significance of the Battle of Chancellorsville in relation to Stonewall Jackson's tactical decisions. Thus, while the path is promising and contains much of the necessary information, it is not entirely complete without additional steps to confirm the tactical impact of the battle, as mentioned in subquestion 3. Therefore, the score is 0.85, reflecting the strong relevance but the need for further refinement.

The given path partially addresses the question by establishing Stonewall Jackson's role as a military commander and his association with the Confederate States of America. However, it does not directly link to the specific battles he fought in, nor does it provide information about his tactical decisions or engagements. To fully answer the question and subquestions, the path would need to include relations that connect Stonewall Jackson to specific battles or engagements. Therefore, the score reflects that while the path is somewhat relevant, it lacks the necessary detail to confidently infer the answers to the question and subquestions.

The given path provides some relevant information but is not entirely complete or direct in addressing all subquestions. It establishes a connection between Stonewall Jackson and the Battle of Chancellorsville, which is one of the major battles he fought in. However, the path then veers off to discuss the Army of Northern Virginia's conflicts, which doesn't directly answer the subquestions about specific engagements or notable battles where his tactical decisions had significant impact. To fully address the subquestions, the path would need to include more direct connections to other battles and specific engagements led by Stonewall Jackson. Nonetheless, the path does provide a starting point and contains valuable information, hence the score of 0.78.

While the path includes some unnecessary steps (such as mentioning the 2nd Louisiana Infantry Regiment), it does provide relevant information to answer the question and subquestions. It helps identify the battles he was involved in and could potentially lead to more detailed information about his participation and tactical decisions. However, the path is not fully optimized and could benefit from direct links to other significant battles he fought in. Therefore, the score is 0.85, indicating a strong likelihood of leading to the correct answers but with room for improvement.

The evidence path starts correctly by linking Stonewall Jackson to the conflicts he participated in, specifically the Seven Days Battles. However, the path then shifts focus to the 2nd Louisiana Infantry Regiment and its notable types, which is not directly relevant to answering the subquestions about the battles Stonewall Jackson fought in. While the path provides some context about the military unit involved in the Seven Days Battles, it does not directly address the specific engagements or tactical impacts of Stonewall Jackson's participation. Therefore, the score reflects that the path partially addresses the question but lacks the necessary direct connections to fully answer the subquestions.

The evidence path provided gives some relevant information about Stonewall Jackson's involvement in the Battle of Chancellorsville, which is one of the major battles he fought in during the Civil War. However, the path is incomplete and does not fully address all the subquestions. It does not provide a comprehensive list of all the battles Stonewall Jackson fought in, nor does it specify his role in other specific engagements or skirmishes. Additionally, it does not highlight any notable battles where his tactical decisions had a significant impact. While the path is on the right track, it needs further refinement and additional steps to fully answer the question and subquestions. Therefore, the score is 0.58.

The evidence path provided gives some relevant information but does not fully address all the subquestions. It correctly identifies that Stonewall Jackson was involved in the Battle of Chancellorsville, which is one of the major battles he fought in. However, the path then veers off into information about the Army of Northern Virginia and its founders, which is not directly relevant to the battles Stonewall Jackson fought in. To fully answer the question and subquestions, the path would need to continue to other battles and engagements that Stonewall Jackson was involved in, and possibly include information about his tactical decisions and their impacts. Therefore, the score reflects that while the path is on the right track, it needs further refinement and additional steps to fully answer the question and subquestions.

The given path provides relevant information about one of the battles that Stonewall Jackson fought in, specifically the Battle of Harpers Ferry. This path helps in answering the first subquestion by identifying a major battle that Stonewall Jackson participated in during the Civil War. Additionally, it can contribute to the second subquestion by providing a specific engagement that he led or took part in. However, the path ends with an intermediate entity 'm.04fvndv' which suggests that there might be more direct connections available. To fully address the third subquestion, we would need additional information about Stonewall Jackson's tactical decisions during the Battle of Harpers Ferry or other battles. Despite this limitation, the path is on the right track and provides valuable information towards answering the overall question and subquestions. Therefore, the score is 0.85.

The evidence path provided is quite relevant to the question and subquestions. It connects Stonewall Jackson to a specific battle he fought in, namely the Battle of Harpers Ferry. This path helps to answer the first subquestion by identifying a major battle that Stonewall Jackson participated in during the Civil War. Additionally, it can potentially lead to other battles by tracing similar paths from other commanders or conflicts. However, the path ends with a loop back to Stonewall Jackson, suggesting that it might not be fully optimized. To improve the score, the path could be extended to include more battles or specific engagements that Stonewall Jackson was involved in, addressing the second and third subquestions more comprehensively. Nonetheless, the current path is highly relevant and provides a strong foundation for reasoning about the question and subquestions.

The evidence path provided gives us a direct link to one of the battles that Stonewall Jackson fought in, specifically the Battle of Harpers Ferry. This is relevant to the first subquestion asking about the major battles he participated in during the Civil War. However, the path ends with an intermediate entity 'm.04fvnf9' which does not provide a clear answer to the question or subquestions. To fully answer the question and all subquestions, we would need to extend the path to include other battles and their details. Nonetheless, the path is on the right track and provides valuable information towards answering the question. Therefore, the score is 0.85.

The given path partially addresses the question by identifying a battle that Stonewall Jackson fought in, namely the Battle of Harpers Ferry. However, the path ends with information about another commander, William Dorsey Pender, rather than providing details about Stonewall Jackson's involvement in the battle or other battles he fought in. While this path is relevant and provides some useful information, it does not fully address all the subquestions, particularly those asking for a comprehensive list of battles and the impact of his tactical decisions. To improve the score, the path would need to continue to focus on Stonewall Jackson's direct involvement and achievements in these battles.

None 

The provided multi-hop evidence path connects Stonewall Jackson to two specific battles he fought in: the Battle of Harpers Ferry and the Battle of McDowell. This path is highly relevant to the subquestions, as it identifies specific engagements that Stonewall Jackson was involved in during the Civil War. However, the path is somewhat convoluted and includes unnecessary steps, such as linking back to Stonewall Jackson after identifying the Battle of Harpers Ferry. Additionally, the inclusion of 'base.culturalevent.event.entity_involved' seems out of place and less relevant to the context of military battles. Despite these minor issues, the path provides key information needed to answer the question and subquestions, making it a strong candidate for reasoning about Stonewall Jackson's battles. Therefore, the score is 0.85.

None 

The provided multi-hop evidence path connects Stonewall Jackson to two significant battles he fought in: the Battle of Harpers Ferry and the First Battle of Bull Run. This path is highly relevant to the question and subquestions, as it identifies specific battles that Stonewall Jackson participated in during the Civil War. It addresses subquestion 1 by identifying major battles, subquestion 2 by specifying engagements, and subquestion 3 by highlighting notable battles where his tactical decisions likely had significant impacts. While the path includes some redundant steps (e.g., connecting back to Stonewall Jackson after mentioning him initially), it still provides strong evidence towards answering the overall question. Therefore, the score for this path is 0.85.
